# GitHub Traffic Analysis Tool

## Overview
This Python script collects detailed traffic statistics for all your GitHub repositories using the GitHub API. It generates:
- A comprehensive text report (`github_traffic_report.txt`)
- An interactive HTML dashboard (`dashboard.html`) powered by Chart.js

The dashboard features dynamic color generation to ensure that each repository’s data is visually distinct—ideal for users with many repositories.

## Features
- **Automatic GitHub User Detection:** Retrieves your GitHub username via the API.
- **Traffic Metrics:** Fetches views and clones (last 14 days), including daily breakdowns and unique counts.
- **Releases Data:** Retrieves release information and download counts (if available).
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizes data with responsive, interactive line charts.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, responsive design with dynamic color generation for large datasets.
- **Ready-to-use Executable:** An attached .exe file (`github_traffic_report_v_1.0.exe`) is available for non-technical users.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: `requests`, `rich`, and optionally `pyperclip` (for clipboard support)
- A valid GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
   git clone https://github.com/RomanTsisyk/GitHub-Traffic-Analysis-Tool.git
   cd GitHub-Traffic-Analysis-Tool
    ```

2.  **Install required packages:**
    
    ```
    pip install requests rich pyperclip
    ```
    

## Usage

1.  Copy your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to your clipboard or have it ready.
2.  Run the script:
    
    ```
    python3 github_traffic_report.py
    ```
    
3.  When prompted, paste or enter your PAT.
4.  The script will generate:
    -   A text report (`github_traffic_report.txt`)
    -   An interactive HTML dashboard (`dashboard.html`)

Open `dashboard.html` in your browser or visit the live demo here: [Live Dashboard](https://romantsisyk.github.io/GitHub-Traffic-Analysis-Tool/dashboard.html) to explore the interactive charts.
